# Self-Driving-Car
This repository demonstrates a real world case study.The aim of this project is to create a model to predict the correct steering angle from the given test image of the road. Here, our loss is Mean Squared Error(MSE). Our goal is to reduce the MSE error as low as possible.

There are total 45406 images in the dataset along with their steering angles. We will split the dataset into train and test in a ratio of 70:30 sequentially.
